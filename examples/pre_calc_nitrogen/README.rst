Calculate 15N PREs with cross-correlation effects
=================================================

This example shows how to PREs for 15N in the presence of CSA-Curie spin cross-correlation effects. :math:`{\Delta\chi}`-tensors are used from a previous PCS fitting.

Script + Explanation
--------------------

First the relevant modules are loaded, the protein and data are read and the data is parsed by the protein.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/pre_calc_nitrogen/pre_calc_nitrogen.py 
	:lines: 1-10

The Tb tensor fitted from PCS data is loaded and the relevant parameters, in this case the magnetic field strength, temperature and rotational correlation time are set.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/pre_calc_nitrogen/pre_calc_nitrogen.py 
	:lines: 13-16

A loop is conducted over the nitrogen atoms that are present in the experimental data. The PRE is calculated using the function :py:func:`paramagpy.metal.atom_pre`. Calculations without CSA are appended to the list ``cal`` and calculations including CSA cross-correlation with the Curie-spin relaxation are appended to the list ``cal_csa``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/pre_calc_nitrogen/pre_calc_nitrogen.py 
	:lines: 19-25

Finally the data are plotted. Clearly CSA cross-correlation is a big effect for backbone nitrogen atoms and should always be taken into account for Curie-spin calculations. Also note the existence and correct prediction of negative PREs!
