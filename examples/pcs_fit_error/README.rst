.. _pcs_fit_error:

Fit a tensor to PCS data with uncertainties
===========================================

This example shows how to conduct a weighted fit of a :math:`{\Delta\chi}`-tensor to experimental PCS data with experimental errors.

Script + Explanation
--------------------

This script follows very closely the script :ref:`pcs_fit`. The only difference being that errors are included in the fourth column of the .npc file and errorbars are included in the plotting routine.
