Constrained Fitting
===================

This example shows how to fit a :math:`{\Delta\chi}`-tensor with constraints applied. The two cases here constrain position to fit a tensor to a known metal ion position form an X-ray structure, and fit an axially symmetric tensor with only 6 of the usual 8 parameters.

The necessary modules are imported and data is loaded

The calcium ion from the X-ray structure is contained in a heteroatom of the PDB file. We set the starting position of the tensor to this position.

To fit the the anisotropy and orientation without position, the linear PCS equation can be solved analytically by the SVD gridsearch method but using only one point with a radius of zero. The Q-factor is then calculated and the tensor is saved.

To fit an axially symmetric tensor, we can used the Non-linear regression method and specify exactly which parameters we want to fit. This will be the axiality ``ax``, two Euler angles ``b`` and ``g`` and the position coordinates. Note that in the output, the rhombic ``rh`` and alpha ``a`` parameters are redundant.
