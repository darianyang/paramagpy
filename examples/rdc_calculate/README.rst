Calculate RDC from a known Tensor
=================================

This example shows how to calculate theoretical RDC values from a known :math:`{\Delta\chi}`-tensor which has been fitted from PCS data. Paramagpy allows seamless calculation of one PCS/PRE/RDC/CCR effect from a tensor fitted from another effect.

Script + Explanation
--------------------

First the relevant modules are loaded, the protein is loaded and the metal is loaded from file. The magnetic field strength and temperature are also set.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/rdc_calculate/rdc_calculate.py
	:lines: 1-8

A loop is made over the atoms of the protein. The amide H and N atoms are selected and then the RDC value is calculated. Finally the formated data is appended to list ``forFile``.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/rdc_calculate/rdc_calculate.py
	:lines: 12-23

The formatted data is written to file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/rdc_calculate/rdc_calculate.py
	:lines: 26-27
