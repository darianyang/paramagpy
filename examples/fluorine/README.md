## Calibrating Fluorine PCS Data

Many of these files are examples, practice, or pdbs used for calculation

#### pcs_fit_test_dchi.py
* This script allows the user to manually input the delta chi tensor
* Calculates the racs values for varying ax, rh, beta, and degree(tag rotation) values
* Displays the racs values heat plots for beta, degrees, ax, and rh

#### Chimera_adj.py and racs.txt
* This script uses chimera to generate new pdb files with tag rotation of the users choice
* The racs values for each pdb are calculated and saved into racs.txt
